# LLaDA-o

Official implementation of **LLaDA-o**, an effective and length-adaptive omni diffusion model for unified multimodal generation and understanding.

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.01068) | [Model](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o)

## Introduction

LLaDA-o extends diffusion language modeling to a unified multimodal setting in which text and visual signals are represented and processed within a shared generative framework. The repository is designed to support both multimodal inference and training, with an emphasis on interleaved reasoning over language and images. In the current release, the codebase includes:

- A reusable multimodal inference pipeline in [`demo_pipeline.py`](./demo_pipeline.py)
- An interactive notebook, [`multimodal_demo.ipynb`](./multimodal_demo.ipynb), for end-to-end inference
- Core modeling components for LLaDA-o under [`modeling/`](./modeling)
- Dataset and preprocessing utilities under [`data/`](./data)
- A training entry point in [`train/pretrain_unified_navit.py`](./train/pretrain_unified_navit.py)

The provided inference workflow is centered on a single shared model instance that can be reused across multiple multimodal tasks. In particular, the notebook demonstrates:

- Text-to-image generation
- Image understanding
- Image editing
- Batch text-to-image generation from [`prompt.txt`](./prompt.txt)

## Highlights

- **Unified multimodal inference**: the same demo pipeline supports generation and understanding within one interface.
- **Reproducible notebook workflow**: [`multimodal_demo.ipynb`](./multimodal_demo.ipynb) offers a self-contained inference entry point with explicit configuration cells and saved outputs.
- **Local checkpoint loading**: the pipeline loads LLaDA-o from a local directory, making it straightforward to use checkpoints downloaded from Hugging Face.
- **Training-ready codebase**: the repository includes data modules, model definitions, and a pretraining script for further experimentation.

## Installation

We recommend creating a dedicated Python environment before installing dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o.git
cd LLaDA-o
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade pyarrow
pip install webdataset
pip install transformers==4.56.2
```

The same setup steps are also recorded in [`init_env.sh`](./init_env.sh).

## Checkpoint Preparation

For inference, first download the released model checkpoint from Hugging Face:

- [GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o)

After downloading, place the checkpoint in a local directory. The inference pipeline expects the directory to contain the LLaDA-o configuration files, tokenizer assets, the VAE checkpoint, and the sharded model index. In particular, the following files are required by [`demo_pipeline.py`](./demo_pipeline.py):

```text
<LOCAL_MODEL_PATH>/
|-- ae.safetensors
|-- ema.safetensors.index.json
|-- llm_config.json
|-- vit_config.json
|-- tokenizer.json / tokenizer.model / tokenizer_config.json
`-- shard files referenced by ema.safetensors.index.json
```

If `ema.safetensors.index.json` is missing, model loading will fail at initialization time.

## Finetuning

The repository includes a finetuning launcher, [`scripts/train.sh`](./scripts/train.sh), with local path placeholders that you can replace on your machine.

### 1. Download the released model locally

Download the model from:

- [GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-o)

Then point both `MODEL_PATH` and `RESUME_FROM` in [`scripts/train.sh`](./scripts/train.sh) to that local directory for the first finetuning run. The script uses:

- `--finetune_from_hf True`
- `--resume_model_only True`
- `--finetune_from_ema True`

So the local Hugging Face model directory is used as the configuration/tokenizer/VAE source as well as the initial EMA checkpoint source.

### 2. Download the example datasets locally

The default example config [`data/configs/example.yaml`](./data/configs/example.yaml) expects two datasets:

- [jackyhate/text-to-image-2M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jackyhate/text-to-image-2M)
- [Open-Bee/Honey-Data-15M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Bee/Honey-Data-15M)

[`data/dataset_info.py`](./data/dataset_info.py) now points to local Hugging Face download directories via environment variables:

- `LLADAO_DATA_ROOT`
- `LLADAO_T2I_2M_DIR`
- `LLADAO_VLM_BEE_DIR`

If you do not set them, the code falls back to these placeholder local paths:

```text
/path/to/local/huggingface_datasets/text-to-image-2M
/path/to/local/huggingface_datasets/Honey-Data-15M
```

Replace those paths with the directories where you store the downloaded datasets, or export the environment variables before launching training.

### 3. Set your training output directories

In [`scripts/train.sh`](./scripts/train.sh), set these paths to locations on your machine:

- `RESULTS_DIR`
- `CHECKPOINT_DIR`
- `WANDB_LOG_DIR`

### 4. Launch finetuning

From the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/train.sh 1 8
```

Or override paths from the shell:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/local/GSAI-ML-LLaDA-o \
RESUME_FROM=/path/to/local/GSAI-ML-LLaDA-o \
RESULTS_DIR=/path/to/your/finetune_run \
CHECKPOINT_DIR=/path/to/your/finetune_run/checkpoints \
WANDB_LOG_DIR=/path/to/your/finetune_run \
LLADAO_T2I_2M_DIR=/path/to/local/text-to-image-2M \
LLADAO_VLM_BEE_DIR=/path/to/local/Honey-Data-15M \
bash scripts/train.sh 1 8
```

On later restarts, `--auto_resume True` lets the trainer prefer the latest checkpoint already written under `CHECKPOINT_DIR`.

## Inference with `multimodal_demo.ipynb`

The recommended way to run inference in this repository is through [`multimodal_demo.ipynb`](./multimodal_demo.ipynb). The notebook provides a unified and reproducible workflow for the main multimodal capabilities currently exposed by the codebase.

### 1. Launch Jupyter

From the repository root:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open [`multimodal_demo.ipynb`](./multimodal_demo.ipynb).

### 2. Set the local model path

In the configuration cell, replace `MODEL_PATH` with the local path of the downloaded Hugging Face checkpoint:

```python
MODEL_PATH = os.environ.get("LLADAO_MODEL_PATH", "/path/to/local/GSAI-ML-LLaDA-o")
```

You may either:

- edit `MODEL_PATH` directly in the notebook, or
- set the environment variable `LLADAO_MODEL_PATH`

The notebook will print a reminder if the placeholder path has not been changed.

### 3. Run the notebook sequentially

The notebook is organized into four practical stages:

1. **Load Model**: initializes `LLaDAMultimodalDemo.from_pretrained(...)` from the local checkpoint directory.
2. **Text-to-Image**: generates a reference image from a textual prompt.
3. **Image Understanding**: uses the generated image as input and produces a textual description.
4. **Image Editing**: edits the reference image according to a new instruction while preserving its overall visual identity.

An additional section supports **batch text-to-image generation** from [`prompt.txt`](./prompt.txt), saving outputs to `demo_outputs/batch_text_to_image/`.

### 4. Outputs

By default, notebook outputs are written to `demo_outputs/`, including:

- `01_text_to_image.png`
- `02_understanding.txt`
- `03_image_edit.png`
- batched images under `demo_outputs/batch_text_to_image/`

### 5. Practical notes

- The notebook should be launched from the repository root, or from a directory named `LLaDA-o` that contains the repository files.
- The current inference path requires at least one CUDA-capable GPU.
- `MAX_MEM_PER_GPU` and `OFFLOAD_DIR` can be adjusted in the notebook if you need to tune memory placement during checkpoint dispatch.
- If you would like to use your own image for understanding or editing, the notebook supports replacing the generated reference image with `load_image("/absolute/path/to/image.png")`.

## Python API

For scripted usage, the notebook workflow is backed by the reusable `LLaDAMultimodalDemo` interface in [`demo_pipeline.py`](./demo_pipeline.py).

```python
from demo_pipeline import LLaDAMultimodalDemo

demo = LLaDAMultimodalDemo.from_pretrained(
    model_path="/path/to/local/GSAI-ML-LLaDA-o",
    max_mem_per_gpu="40GiB",
    offload_dir="/tmp/lladao_offload",
)

result = demo.text_to_image("A studio-quality product photo of a glass teapot shaped like a tiny planet.")
image = result["image"]
image.save("sample.png")
```

The same interface also exposes:

- `demo.understand(image, prompt, **kwargs)`
- `demo.edit_image(image, prompt, **kwargs)`

This makes it straightforward to migrate from notebook-based experimentation to Python-based evaluation scripts.

## Evaluation

The repository includes text-to-image evaluation support under [`eval/`](./eval):

- **GenEval**: distributed image generation plus Mask2Former/OpenCLIP scoring.
- **DPG-Bench**: distributed image generation, 2x2 grid construction, and mPLUG VQA scoring.

See [`eval/README.md`](./eval/README.md) for the full environment setup, external model downloads, and benchmark commands.

In short, after installing the base environment and downloading the LLaDA-o checkpoint, install the optional benchmark dependencies and run:

```bash
export LLADAO_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/local/GSAI-ML-LLaDA-o

# GenEval
bash eval/gen/geneval/evaluation/download_models.sh \
  ./eval/gen/geneval/evaluation/models/mask2former
export GENEVAL_DETECTOR_MODEL_PATH=./eval/gen/geneval/evaluation/models/mask2former
bash scripts/eval/run_geneval_dllm.sh "$LLADAO_MODEL_PATH"

# DPG-Bench
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TencentQQGYLab/ELLA/main/requirements-for-dpg_bench.txt
bash scripts/eval/run_dpg_dllm.sh "$LLADAO_MODEL_PATH" /path/to/dpg_prompts.jsonl
```

All local paths can be overridden through environment variables documented in [`eval/README.md`](./eval/README.md).
